# Evan-Tetris
My First game!
Menu:
up & down arrow = select;
enter = enter;

Game:
left & right arrow = move;
up = spin;
down = drop;
p = pause;
r = restart;

About:
Any key = back to menu;


First version: 08/24/2021
  Pros: Basic functions all complete! The game is ok to go. Menu, About and game page are created. All pics are drew by myself!
  Cons: Some bugs are still existed but not too harmful: consistantly pressing down will result some blocks (especially vertical I type) to cross the boundry.
    Solution: Prohibit drop action when blocks are below a certain level without affecting gamers' experience, but the bug still happens sometimes.
